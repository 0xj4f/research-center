everybody remember this slide this uh this picture from uh national enquirer because it was a disreputable uh you know journal it's like that's the one on the left by the way early 2000 hackers can turn your computer into a bomb well luckily uh journalism has progressed since then we've become more educated more aware except for the telegraph you know july 24 2009 terrorists could use your the internet to launch a nuclear attack the hype is still going on because it's still a topic that will scare people okay what this talk is going to be about is not going to be giving you the answers sorry it's going to be giving you hopefully some questions and stuff you know that you can start a discussion on you can start actually uh learning about what actual is cyber warfare and what it means and what we can do about it um a little bit about me i've got two jobs i got a night job and a day job my night job is i'm cio strategy one solutions uh pin testing company we do penetration testing uh consulting uh incident response corporate espionage i've been an expert witness in a couple ri cases against not four and also um a couple of forensic analysis you know some of the fun stuff my day job is i'm the avp of a major financial institution where i do incident handling ids monitoring firewall monitoring you know all the boring stuff it's like uh i say it halfway in just because i've had a lot of exciting attacks and stuff you know that have gone on during the work day that we've been able to respond to and that's what i think is the key things it's about having fun i tell people if you're an information security because you know it's a good career choice you're losing okay it's like the other side's having a blast we should too and speaking of hackers it's like start off with one of the first ones that i know about uh sun tzu i tell people um when you want to learn how to cook you go to france when you want to learn how to paint you go to italy when you want to learn how to do uh military strategies you go to china it's like that's where it's from it's like 500 years ago uh 500 bc warfare was very simple in china okay i take all my guys with sharp 20 objects you take all your guys with sharp 20 objects you run at each other okay whoever dies the most loses pretty simple you know sun tzu thought outside the box sun tzu decided to change the way those strategies were done he would actually use the terrain to actually coerce the enemy or coax the enemy into terrain into situations that would benefit him he did the first buffer overflow by going into the valley and stuff you know and retreating and stuff you know then letting his forces that weren't as numerous wipe the floor with his enemies he did the first uh one of the first zero days it's like he sent assassins into the general's uh tent general's gone war's over battle's won so it's like i think he's a hacker so when i'm saying hacker i'm not saying good hacker or bad hacker i'm just saying hacker somebody thinks it's outside the box so i don't want to get up into the labels um also just to show you exactly how current sun tzu is uh 2 400 years later this is a picture i took in sao paulo's airport at a bookstore this book is being taught in harvard and west point so it is definitely a good book to read let's go through the uh well we're halfway through the intro so far so good you are still here awesome then we're going to talk about some of the caveats about what this talk is about and and how we're going to do it then a history geography lesson that will be you know hopefully keep you awake talk about some of the players and the haters and how everybody here is actually involved and then hopefully a good discussion in room 104 or i'm sure here also yes i'm sorry about not being here for spot the fed um a serious outbreak of a case of the stupids came about um you know it was just last night when i was telling hotel security that when i came i started defcon 4 doing this and the kids at defcon 4 were now bringing their kids to defcon and how as a community and as a group we had matured past a lot of the dumbass things we used to do well murphy's law of course had to be proved wrong that like i said there's been a rash of an outbreak of the case of the stupids where several people now are going to jail for felonies um it's rare to see me this upset i generally am an even tempered person i'm now very very upset we are for lack of a better term a community or a family i expect better of you defcon 9 was our worst year in terms of things that happened we almost didn't come back thankfully you guys stepped up and we did come back please do not make an ass out of yourselves and us by degrading back to that level if you see someone about to do something stupid instead of going either snitches get stitches or haha that's going to be very funny think for a minute act your age do not act like a 13 year old and stop them if you are planning to bungee jump off the roof or you think it's funny to try to bungee dump off the roof you will go to jail you will face a felony they will catch you and we will be in more trouble is there anyone here who does not like the alexis park is there anyone here would like to go to a hotel that's much worse than this please raise your hand because if you keep this up we will not be here okay i'm sorry to be a downer i especially like the sun zero zero day reference that was pretty cool i'm gonna use that one myself but i'm not going to credit you because i'm an but it's okay i'm in touch with my inner ass also don't agree too vehemently there guys thank you and no tmi is pictures and i'll be happy to provide them just for you your own personal hell what's that yeah you can wait sir matter of fact for you you're gonna wait a little bit longer so blame him sock full of quarters meet him outside where there's no cameras so please guys seriously knock off the ass hattery okay there's there's a there's another incident where the fiance is in tears and the guy's walking out of here in handcuffs he's going to spend at least two days in jail because they want to rain him until monday and that goes for anybody else here if you go to jail tonight you're not seeing a judge until monday and remember this is a casino the rules are different here they're much more severe please do not put yourselves or us in a position where they don't want us here it just takes one to screw it up for the rest of us okay thank you for your time and i was thinking all the ways i could lose my train of thought jericho would be with the worst it's like yeah okay and i was where yes for my first presentation this is going epically awesome it's like uh so so now what we're talking about is where did i get this information what's going on how did i get started in it it's like a little famous plug i just start i just wrote one book i'm working on a second one and what that second book deals with the cyber warfare well i want to be accurate i want to try to get as much information as i can and i started started doing a lot of research on the internet about cyber warfare and different reports i totally ripped off a lot of stuff from thedarkvisitor.com which is an awesome website and i started getting all this information together and i was like you know what it's like maybe i can give a talk on so i gave a talk at a cyber warfare conference in oklahoma city and i realized one important thing i'm reporting other people's work all i'm doing is reading other people's research forming my opinions on those so i decided just within the within like a month i got my passport for the first time i went to ex-con in beijing i went to ccc in berlin i spoke at a conference in brazil and i went to uh siscan in shanghai and ph neutral in berlin i started going to these places i started traveling and i started trying to figure out exactly what's going on talking to the people that are there at these hacking conferences and these security conferences what their opinions of were of their country what they thought was going on toward them from from other countries so i was talking to the chinese hackers about the west attacking them as well as you know the uh east attacking the west it's like it's a two-way street there and so that's what started getting me understanding it's like we're understanding topics we're understanding incidents we're not really trying to learn the culture and the also the motivation behind a lot of this and so that's where i started trying to start investigating trying to figure out exactly what are the motivators what are the things that we can foster discussion and start a better understanding what this topic is awesome because you're doing so well yes if there's a free seat would you please raise your hand high everyone who is either in the back or the front let's say the dividing line here by the camera whatever would you please come forward and take a seat we just want to make sure that you cannot block the aisles and leave aisles open okay okay there should really be something besides diet pepsi in here and we're back um so one of the things i also want to make sure that there's a good caveat about okay this is my perception this is my perspective from my experiences and the research that i've gathered okay i tell people you take a diamond you take that one fast and you pull it up to your eye you're getting a distorted view you're getting you're not getting the whole picture it's going to be distorted if you really want to appreciate the beauty of a diamond you have to look away from it and look at all the facets so i'm not saying i have the only facet i'm not saying i have the only pers perception and that my case is this is the way it works you have other evidence you have other perceptions you have other experiences that helps bring this together and that's another key thing we all have to get all the facets communicating and stuff so we can understand the picture a little bit better now let's start off i when i travel i think this is a universal fact around the globe we all have those cities that are out in the countryside you know your neighbor you keep the doors locked unlocked it's like you know your kids can go out and play and everything will be fine right it's like a nice little wholesome uh little town well guess what you put your computer on the internet in that nice little wholesome town your neighbors are paraguay china russia the us canada and they don't always like you it's like you're an opportunity for a resource for either political motivations for criminal motivations you know basically usually just money because they like sending spam but that's what it's about you're a number you're no longer geographically fixated to one spot you're now sharing band with the rest of the world okay that's one big global pool and when one person pees in it everybody's gonna feel it so that's what this is about it's like you have to understand that there's a new way that we have to start thinking about geography this quote from ambrose pierce is one of my favorites war is god's way of teaching americans geography well guess what we have to learn a new way because the battlefield is no longer based in the real world today it's in the board room it's in the dorm room it's located in kansas as well as dc new york as well as kiev that's where these battles are happening now so yes these are some of the people that we're going to be talking about yes i'll probably be pissing some of them off but that's just the way it goes it's like uh talk about china russia we're going to talk about some jihadism uh we're talking about some of the more players that are out there and of course you know i call out us and uh and our friends i'm not a for sports player i'm sorry okay i don't play i don't know that much about football but i was assured and someone guaranteed me that terrell owens fits the picture he's he's very talented he does very well but he's got a very big attitude people like to you know knock on am i right is that correct okay good that's awesome because that's china it's like very talented very good at what they do and people like to hate on them and uh and they've got a very bad attitude sometimes um what i'm talking about here though is the i want to start off with the definition of the red hacker alliance everybody's familiar with the dc network right you're all part of dc something or other your area code dc405 dc214 dc 4420 okay well that's what this is about the red hacker alliance is exactly like that they're dc groups so to speak there are online communities of hackers in china well what happened and we'll get to that a little bit later is that they started to form an alliance say dc 405's got a problem something's going on they put out the message that they're having trouble dc 4420 decides to join them in that cause dc214 decides to join the cause and so instead of having one little group you now have an army of people going after attacking websites or doing what the purpose is of that goal and when you're talking about the chinese and the red hacker alliance you're talking during a mobilization over a million people okay we're not talking about all uber elite hackers coming after you okay if i get shot with one bb gun i'm gonna get pissed okay i get shot with a million the effects are going to vary okay and that's what this is all about so it's like you also have to understand it's also about the numbers but now let's get into some of the other things that we don't talk about that much the culture we always hear about china it's like we don't really take time to really understand some of the stuff about china a lot of the attacks i think are starting to lessen right now it's like this last year it's like you haven't heard that much in the news about the the chinese attacking here the chinese attacking there and uh one of my things that i learned while in my travels was one of the possible contributing factors is very simple this is the year six five two one the chinese have two astrological calendars those two calendars together form a 60-year cycle which this is the ending of so it's a very time of very you know of change of things going one way or the other well the ill omen part of this is five two one five fifty years ago the dalai lama was uh asked to leave it's like uh 20 years ago there was a small incident in a square in beijing and 10 years ago the fulangong was outlawed in china so those omens coinciding with what's going on maybe we need to think about exactly why green dam's being formed now why are they shutting down these social sites october 1st is the 60th year anniversary of the ascension of mao so they're maybe a little nervous they're trying to get everything their ducks in a row also you have to ask yourself if a hacker's trying to lay low now at the beginning of the new chinese new year next year what are they going to unleash what are they going to bring out and stuff out of the toolbox that they've been waiting for that'll give you a comforting thought right there on that one another thing that really totally torques me okay that picture on the left is not china that's not china that's like saying a whole picture of america that's america okay what about the yankees and the southerners and the east coast west coast you know the whole tupac biggie rivalry come on it's like it's a multi-factor multicultural country if this country's multi-cultural it's like why aren't the others in china on the right that's china multiple provinces different languages different cultures within those and another little interesting fact shanghai hackers love hacking beijing hackers it's awesome for them because they compromise those beijing hackers computers form their bot nets take over their botnets and then they lease those to other nation states other criminal organizations and then they're actually going in and uh you're getting an attack coming from china there you go was that from china or was that from the person sponsoring the chinese hackers and paying them they don't care if it says it's coming from china because everybody likes to say that their attacks are coming from china they're still getting paid and then you've got the beijing hackers hacking the shanghai hackers and doing the exact same thing and then once again you get your attack coming from china another little tidbit is they started this a long time ago well on internet years it's a long time ago 1997 was the formation of the the green army by goodwill back in 1988 was the anti-chinese rise in indonesia that actually provided the catalyst when i was talking about that call out to the dc groups in indonesia they were having a lot of hard feelings with the chinese immigrants and the chinese nationals and there was beatings and attacks on a chinese nationalist in indonesia well that started the formation of the green hacker alliance where all these hacker groups decide to come together and attack the indonesian websites indonesian government uh in government sites uh 2000 the honker union of china was founded by lyon china eagle union was founded by wan tao and java file was founded by cool swallow and blonde one of the things on where are they now one of the things that mirrors the hacking culture in the u.s and the hacking culture in china is hackers grow old okay it's like you know being that outlaw bad guy and stuff you know it's like gets harder with age uh kevin polson mark mayford ring a bell bad hackers gone legit goodwill major security consultant now for billion dollar uh companies and organizations and the chinese government in china uh uh wan tao china eagle union still around but he's also an ibm researcher so you know it's like you got to make a living somewhere and stuff you know sometimes crime doesn't pay as well as you know ibm so um we all remember 2001 don't we when i say 2001 there's a date popping up in your head but what about april april 2001 there was a air force plane flying over near china that collided with a chinese jet fighter that jet fighter pilot lost his life and the air force crew on board were guests of the chinese government for a few weeks and during that time created a lot of tension will u.s hackers not really understanding exactly the whole dynamics and obviously not knowing about the red hacker alliance decide to teach the chinese a lesson and start an attack and web defacements on chinese websites to free the crew well guess who got the call out and guess what formed up the red hacker alliance got together and started the thousand web defacement protesting the death of the chinese pilot and they won that one but we learned it's like we kept learning from our mistakes one of the other things they talk about when you talk about the chinese hacking in the timeline was the year 2005 because prior to that 1997 up to around 2005 there was a major block for the chinese hackers there was a there was an impediment that they were having to overcome and it's a stumbling block that they had to deal with english all the hacking programs are in english all the programs and the key codes and stuff that you have to know are english so that posed a problem not not since 2005 when they started reverse engineering they started creating their programs in chinese great asked the uk government about that one the great pigeon trojan in their mail system back in 2005. that's when we really got a good taste of chinese ingenuity and uh programming um another thing i want to bring up about the culture of china is patriotism i gave this talk in brazil and saying that i'm a us patriot in brazil is a lot different than saying i'm a u.s patriot in the u.s but why does it being a patriot in one country make you a less of a patriot than another just because we're from another country you got to understand when you talk about once again the chinese culture when you are born day one you are chinese you are part of the collective you are part of the group your ancestors were emperors your civilization that you can trace back to the formation of your country was thousands of years you're part of the communist party from birth part of the collective so they are very patriotic they're very they may disagree with their governments at points but when the west attacks china not the government they attack china they are attacking these these hackers they're attacking these peoples and they will respond in kind it is once again part of the culture and how they operate and how they believe that they are chinese and they should not be messed with it's like you know they don't want to be called out it's like you can talk about one certain political areas and stuff you know but one that goes to the nationalism those are off limits but another good thing is we export a lot of things here in the west one of them was capitalism ask a certain india company company back in 2008 when they lost a bid um just by just narrowly missing that bid to the chinese company it wasn't until two months later that they found out that there were chinese trojans and programs in their network which allowed the chinese company to underbid them just much and before you start going and saying how bad the chinese are about corporate espionage it's like uh where's the french people in the room oh there you are it's like other governments let's say are known to do corporate espionage on the on behalf of companies so that that does go around so let's uh start off with the russians now i want to say i'm drinking pepsi because i'm allergic to polonium tea um but uh one of the things i do like about the russian army is that they're honest about it they don't hide it they don't try to deny anything they're right out there with it the russian fifth division cyber army their military budget 40 billion us all together the global rating you know tied at number four one of the key things is that their global warfare budget is 127 million offensive okay come on that's on the books you're looking at at least two billion off books right it's like i know there's some feds in here and you know that's true so one let's look at some of the toys they've got in their their little play chest uh large advanced bot botnets for ddos and espionage botnets ddos's i wonder if they've used that recently how about electromagnetic pulse weapons non-nuclear thank goodness advanced dynamic exploitation capabilities wireless data communication jammers trying to stop the flow of information their cyber weapons capabilities ratings is advanced they know what they're doing and they've got 23 million computers and dsl connections to do something with it i believe that if you give a cyber warfare talk now it's the cardinal rule that you have to mention estonia at least once so i'm mentioning estonia it's like but not just uh for the sake of being a good cyber warfare talk but also because of the fact that we have to understand one important thing why instead of the technical and the political motivations it's like i've got a theory my perceptions the way i look at it the way i see it say i'm a major you know country a very large country and i've got to build a budget say of 120 something million dollars a year to build all kinds of really cool tdos and tools what's these having toys if you can't play with them how are you going to test them how are you going to get them in a real world scenario well what would how would you like to actually attack say another major country like the us five to ten years from now you know a country like the u.s in five to ten years would have voting online they have all their bill pays online they'd be a very internet connected community it's like mostly all their uh government facilities and stuff you know are done uh through the internet and connected through the internet that would be great to be able to try to attack you know a country like that five to ten years from now but how do you do it now how do you see what the tools would react now well in estonia in april and oh by the way you may not know about estonia but here's a couple of facts they're one of the most wired countries in the world they do all their voting online they do all their bill pay online their government's highly connected their leader said that the internet is a basic human right some would even say they're where america is going to be in you know five to ten years but i'm sure that's coincidence let's keep going um so there was a statue it got moved it got upset that was opportunity what happened afterwards may or may not have been government motivated those may have been some tools coming out of the pla the toy chest uh to be used in uh you know taking notes over and see how what worked and what what didn't work but you can't just do one beta let's talk about beta 2.0 let's talk about georgia okay one of the key things that we learned in estonia is a highly uh cyber attack is not is going to be totally as effective unless you mix a little you know couple bombs and tanks in there it's like it's about communication that's the reason why i really don't like to determine cyber warfare and yes i know i use it very frequently it's information warfare that's the actual target if i can deny my opponent information if i can get information from my opponent he does not know that i have it's like or if i can disseminate false information that's how battles are won that is how wars are won from the dawn of history usually the wars have been hinging not just on the body count but the information that is vital to create those plans and carry out those uh attacks so what do we have there we had actual attacks on television stations and cell towers in the real world at the same time distributed denial services attacks were happening to those same outlets there was a coordinated attack no i do not have the graphs i know people that do and i can tell you who they are later but they're out there where you can actually see the kinetic attack with the non kinetic attack almost happening simultaneously that was government sponsored that was an attack to see exactly what else can we do with these toys now let's go uh where's 3.0 going to happen kazakhstan might know and another thing is before you start talking and saying it's like well this is preposterous it's like how would a major you know country deal with this it's like why would they do things like this are they really capable of doing that are they really capable of actually attacking another nation like that and filling the repercussions and stuff you know of the u.n and all these other governing bodies that you know say no no got gas russia cut the natural gas pipeline to europe in january natural gas you know for heating you know might help keep you warm they cut the gas because they could that didn't take balls i don't know what did okay that's the kind of country this stuff you know that might be capable of doing a couple of online attacks and stuff you know and seeing what they can get with it this is my don't fall me slide it's like because quite frankly and stuff you know i want to understand that once again looking through those different facets sometimes we narrow our facets to just one specific part of a religion and say that's the religion that's like from the west if you're uh from outside the of the united states and you're watching television and you see some of these uh churches that are doing church uh bombings and they're they're doing all these uh signs that say you know god loves dead soldiers uh the u.s can go to hell is that christianity i don't think so it's one facet that's one extreme we can't just look at one slide and one of the things i think a lot of people in the west haven't really read the quran they haven't really understood it they haven't really tried to read it and find out what's in there so some of them might be actually surprised to find out that jesus christ is actually mentioned in the quran with reverence and respect so that's just a little bit of food uh for thought you know before i go in and start can talk start talking about that one little facet it's like uh but that's what we're talking about here so the funny thing about the jihadist what people like to say like in the telegraph they were talking about you know they want to start nuclear war three main reasons uh the jihadists use the internet communication recruitment and propaganda how do they do the how do they accomplish those three main things with the internet so when we talk about these online attacks and how they want to bring down the internet do we really think that they want to bring down the very means of their communication propaganda and recruitment when you can put when you blow up a mall okay that's terrorism that's terrifying okay when you take down amazon.com that's black thursday okay there is a difference with that you have to understand the difference and also yes cyber crime is there are starting to fund more cyber crime there are starting to actually get more involved with the cyber crime trying to get money off of that you know what the biggest trade that the jihadists are using to fund themselves with who said that fed okay i'm helping you guys out here okay because the last one went so bad all right so yes it's a drug trade they feel that drugs are homorep which means forbidden so what better way than to grow something and distribute something that kills the infidels and then use the money that they give you for that privilege to kill more infidels but i mean that's you know win-win situation for somebody it's like i still don't understand the virgins but that's a whole other thing okay now let's talk about some other guys because you know i really thoroughly want to piss off you know mostly every industrialized nation before i'm done um so let's talk about south america brazilian hackers pretty cool they're really good you guys rock it's like but uh brazil crimes uh hacking's not a criminal it's not sexy you know it's not an outlaw thing it's like so you got mostly resilient hacking brazilians you're not actually going after nation states trying to topple them uh the eastern europe you know i talked about you know a little bit before about how we export things we exported movies okay we're real good the west has real good exporting movies well we shipped a couple good movies over there um the godfather scarface goodfellows great entertainment unless you use it as a training video okay and that's exactly what the eastern europeans like good ideas now they brought that into you know online 2.0 so you know they'll hold your uh they'll ransom your files they'll whack your website you know they'll do some drive-by malware on you okay they're learning and they're uh they're still doing the physical real world so that's why i'm going to talk about them too so but once again the reason why we're not talking about too much about them is because you know crime's not that much of warfare unless it's actually intended for that part and it's really hard to tell but one prediction that i do have within the next five to ten years every major industrialized nation will have a cyber warfare unit we protect our food supply we protect our trade routes we protect our borders why not our bandwidth when our economy and our government and our country runs on the internet why wouldn't we protect those so you're going to start seeing these more out there and speaking of uh aging x and uh the north the non-north korean ddos i like to call it is exactly one of the formations in in the testings and the evolution of cyber warfare of informational warfare because this was informational warfare it was disinformation what is the best way to go and test reactions on a country well first of all you don't want to get caught you know i mean hello it's like it's good and fun you know to trip the fire alarm as long as there's not a camera there you know catching you do it so you make sure you have your fall guy and you launch attacks maybe at one enemy uh one enemy that y of one person and then the ally of that enemy so then everybody goes okay a and b are getting attacked it's like it must be c really and and your thing is like no jason that's too stupid it's like he would actually think that within a week of july 4th a congressman was saying that we should attack north korea okay a little scary because obviously we're not really getting it here in the united states the reason why oh by the way at the guy next to you starting to pucker a little bit it's like fed i'm trying i'm trying to help you because by this time they've already read that part of the slide and you know they're wondering what i'm going to talk about next um but let's start off with a 2004 pentagon statement on the military readiness where they actually stated that for a response of a cyber warfare incident they would actually consider a nuclear strike really ddos yanuk the city i'm dropping malware there's a battalion coming for me i start spamming and there's a b-52 well actually that would actually be pretty effective it's like you know okay so that's what i'm saying it's like once again we're trying to get there but we're not really understanding it 2003 was a really good lesson titan reign not purple rain much worse than this okay it was titan rain which actually woke up you know americans say no people really do want to go after certain networks that we have and uh so yes they'll go after the nipper net it's like what's going to be next i said nippernet did they see anybody react really okay because maybe they couldn't read it all the way back there and stuff you know so it's like i promise not to say you know skiff or sippernet and make someone going oh wait sorry okay so let's uh let's get let's keep where we're going oh i'm calling everybody out okay everybody is starting when i said five to ten years cyber warfare industrialized nations no we're already working there okay south koreans have already got one they really need a lot of funding and stuff you know to get that going and stuff you know it's like it's not like they're a victim of attack which could generate some sympathy to help shore that up um that's just a position to hope to get a chuckle from somebody uh but the japanese germans just started one they're getting one going uk's have one for a while right major it's like the uk's had it for a while it's like uh and the israelis yes i mentioned israelis in the cyber warfare talk and stuff you know with government people it's like night late 1990s shin bought israeli forces you know they did a little uh peugeot uh uh fuel depot north of tel aviv yeah they got a cyber warfare unit up real quick after that so israeli fed by the way so what have we got to learn from this okay one of the key things we have to stop trying to learn things from this we're trying to develop a way to do battle in the future you know and tomorrow with last year's technology instead of you know and trying to get it together today that's worked when you're building tanks and bombs and airplanes we're not talking years now we're talking nanoseconds when you don't know where the new zero day is coming out you don't know what the next vulnerability is going to be released we have to start understanding the complexity and how fast these things change on the ground and also the anonymity of from where these attacks come from it's like how do you do a proper offense when you don't really know who's the one shooting you and i'm telling you when you talk about cyber warfare and you talk about information warfare you talk about all these different nation states i tell you this if a guy in his basement owns a hundred thousand computers and he targets your website on it that's an attack that's information warfare welcome to the new general that's the way warfare is heading it's not heading where it's just all the big boys get to play okay it's no longer just you know this one army that you have to deal with they're coming from all over different places and yes they're attacking from within like we've never seen that before did i mention i gave a conference in oklahoma city so now what do we do well we have to start understanding what's going on we have to start understanding without knowing and i'm going to read because i hate reading from slides but without understanding where the opponent's weaknesses are you cannot borrow their strengths to use against them like i said i like chinese military quotes because they know what they're doing and it's true you have to start understanding the whole picture just like sun tzu said you can't just understand one side of it anymore you have to understand the other side you have to understand both if you actually really want to be victorious in a battle so well actually this slide doesn't make sense now because i told you you know that we got to do it in room 104. oh by the way that's it dudes no more tricks that's i started early and i talked really fast so
