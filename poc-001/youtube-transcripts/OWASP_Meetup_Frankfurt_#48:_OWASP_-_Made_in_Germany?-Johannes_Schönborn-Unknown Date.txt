recording starters as you everybody aware is that we will be recording so if you want to turn off your cameras actually it's not going to be on the recording so that should be fine okay again welcome to our obvious frankfurt dumpsters 48 and this time in the second virtual edition this year i'm dangora and together with johannes schonborn we are delighted to give you a full roundup on various os projects that have been actively influenced by the german community and that also includes projects such as the juice shop the devsecops maturity model security pins and much more so stay tuned to learn about different os projects and then also we conclude this with a interesting talk about physical red teaming and just what could happen what could go wrong in in a red teaming assessment but before we get started let's have a short discussion or short run up on virtual housekeeping rules as you're aware is that the rules are different from our previous in-person meetings we hope you know where your toilet is and how to use your local fire extinguisher however we kindly ask you to mute your mic during the course of the presentation and turn off your video just to save bandwidth be aware that actually teemo is okay if you unmute yourself during the course of the presentation so feel free just to go ahead and ask questions anytime and also be aware that the session is going to be recorded on youtube and be made available after that also includes the slides also if you have any questions just use the slider q a section so if you just have slider open that's perfect and use zoom chat provided as well as we're going to afterwards we're going to send out some feedback slider votes so provide any suggestions and yeah just please share your feedback on what you want in the next time what you like what you didn't like and whether you're interested in giving some other talks so again we just we have the vote i think that's pretty clear for most people so we've got quite a balanced audience and most people have never used os related context but are aware of it or just use some os project and content but only a few times so i think that's something that is going to be quite interesting for for everybody to to learn more about it before we get started just brief update on owasp itself and what's been happening or what's actually currently happening um if you are not aware is uh or maybe you might be aware that o wasp is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year and that means that the obas calendar is packed full with exciting community events training events and lighting it talks and also there's going to be a big conference coming up on the uh on september and i think most of i think the conf itself is also free so just stay tuned there will be more information made available after as soon as we come closer to that date otherwise in the meantime if you're interested in some lightning talks i can highly recommend the lightning conference which is the next one is coming up on the may 12th and it's going to be around hacking apis for beginners that's going to feature katy paxton fear which is uh who's we be giving a really interesting talk on just getting started with hacking apis also this is this time in a reasonable time zone it's 18 o'clock german time and if you want to sign up it's fully free just go on lightning.org.org and it lasts around 90 90 minutes also if you are interested in a bit more deep dive around application security you should check out our virtual training series events which are running usually in a multi-day format and they are focusing usually on quite interesting application security topics so the next one is coming up on the 25th to the 26th of may and this will be focused on different seminars around devsecops hacking modern web apps as well as around kubernetes security so if you're interested in in a bit more deep dive over like training events i think this is definitely worthwhile checking it out be aware that the price for the two-day training series will cost you around 500 us dollars uh considering that this is a two-day training event that's i think a reasonable price but yeah if you if you're just interested otherwise just join the lightning talks enough updates for now let's get you started with our exciting program highlights so first of all we will have timo pagle who will be sharing his overview of def secop's ova's projects especially ones that he has worked actively or contributed active himself and also on the ones that he's using as part of his day-to-day work that's gonna be really interesting and every full roundup afterwards i will be showing a hands-on session using the osu shop so giving you an overview how to get started how to do a install the juice shop and then doing some really interesting challenges around cross-site scripting sql injection as well as finding hidden information on the due shop afterwards we are going to conclude the evening with an exciting talk on physical red teaming and mikhail stony ivig will be sharing his experience of how he conducted physical red teaming assessments in financial service companies and there's all the things that went wrong during the course of those assessments so let me welcome you now to our key speaker timo pagle who will be presenting his overview of death sec ops owas projects just shortly about teemo parker he's currently a security architect located in hamburg and he has got over 15 years of experience both in system integration and web security he's currently a freelancer and as well as a trainer working in his own company and at the same time he's a very active os community member so really delighted to have you here timo are you ready to present sure thank you for the nice introduction yep you're welcome you should be able to see my screen now yes we can see your screen good so let's let's start uh you already gave a nice introduction so we can skip this let us directly start with uh with a strategic view and this will be kind of also our agenda for today so this is an overview of how um an information security management system over software issuance maturity model and over step sake of maturity model play together so on the top we have here the information security management system and some of the things which are required by by the information security management system are covered by sam especially obviously the the software related stuff and the operations related requirements over them itsaf has different practices which are aligned in a very nice way so that it's uh it's good to look at it from a management point of view and they some of them align directly to uh devsec ops management to the dev sec ops maturity model uh dimensions which you can see here for example build and deployment but there are also connections between sometimes um so this is a more technical view why this is more an overview and the nice thing is here for example in test and verification you get a close to step-by-step information on how to implement automated security tests for example so sam is kind of a standard i would say which is very often used that provides a high level overview it's very good to to assess your company to see where are you right now and where do you want to be in the next months in the next three months in the next year or in five years then you can plan your high level targets um and then you move i suggest that you take a look after you have your high level targets to the devsec ops maturity model um yeah it's it's more emerging i wouldn't call it standard but i see it more and more used um and it's more low level it's very close to the technical implementation uh it also has a mapping for example to iso and sam so that you can easily pick the ones you would like to have the the activities you would like to implement um you could also use it as a documentation um that's what i'm doing at uh at one client so we use the application here to document what we're having and then this is a cso can create an excel export and use it right away as i said we will use this as kind of an agenda for today so we start with it with the devsec ops dimensions here which are part of the devsec operating model and we will go through them through most of them let's say through most of them and we start with uh with culture and organization and that is the first uh first part because from my point of view all the technical things are just technical problems which are easily solvable from my point of view and the cultural organization things that are the ones which are taking time to implement and to let it grow um one thing which which you should do in the start um that is also recommended by sam and diesem to have security champions and when you want to start the security champions the question is how do i start with security question how to integrate it and the security in the over security champions playbook provides a way on on how you can actually um implement security champions it doesn't mean that you need to follow this completely but you get an idea on how to do it so you first need to identify your teams then you need to define the role what actually does security champion means for your organization doesn't mean the person is responsible for security or is is the security champion just a contact point uh and and doesn't have uh responsibility by itself um that are things which you need to discuss in the star especially with the management because i have the experience that mostly you start with yeah they are the contact point because that's good for culture and then as soon as the the company grows uh the management would like to change this store too so that the security champion becomes more responsible uh then you need to nominate security champions you need to define communications channels a knowledge base where you can share your knowledge and obviously you need to maintain the interest in the security champions program which you created i personally ah like to perform um a meeting where all security champions of an organization come together and i actually do it uh b weekly so every two weeks and we are meeting for one and a half hour so uh that is a very high investment so you need to be very confident when you present that to your to the management uh but when in case security is important then you're the management uh might agree on it maybe you you find another schedule like once in a month but this provides the ability to to discuss pain points with the security champions uh and what is running good so you you can what i'm doing is asking a team very no where i know that something is going good to to to tell their experience so that other people get to know the experience of their team um within the security champions with this within this one and a half hour uh we don't talk the whole time about problems and good things from the teams i also give a training in that one and a half hour so one very nice application uh you actually i actually got a because i contributed multiple times to the juice shop um but you would also get one in case you make nice contributions um so the dew shop is a training application it is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web applications so it it has one abilities by intention so that you uh you or or you with a team can explore these vulnerabilities and [Music] um think about how what could we do better in our own applications i don't want to talk too much about this because afterwards we have a year we are getting uh um a nice talk provided by dan so i will not talk more about it um yeah okay one one thing i can say uh the overstock 10 obviously covered by the uh overshoe shops it was top 10 is a an awareness document so it's er it carries the most uh the top 10 threats uh for web applications uh it's recreated every year three years i think was a target uh so maybe we can expect from this year the latest version is from 2017 and it's very great for an initial planing training plan and i have to add that when you do this for wire um that you might want to do these topics again so i have experience that there is a lot of changes in the teams so people are leaving a company and then other people are are coming to that organization newly hired and it means that these new people needs to be trained again right so you when you perform sql injection in in one year after after year you have to think do i need to present this again wrong direction um we also saw here in the in the play play uh in the playbook maintain interest so how do we maintain interest i would say maintain interest in security one way is to provide reports so you can provide rewards especially to people here that is what this icon should mean so directly to people not to teams you can provide high fives you can say okay you did a very nice job and then you provide a high five it's a bit more more complicated in the in a virtual world but it's also possible to use iq emojis for that and another way is pins i uh developed um these security pins that is the novice project over security pins uh which you can see here that the different pins um on on this head to to maintain the interest uh when i first created uh this program the security champion program and i invited uh people from from all the teams uh i think i invited 40 and uh to that event and in total uh four or five people i came to that first first security champion training and i was very disappointed and i thought how can i enhance the interests and the way i was to provide these these iq these pins physical handouts for for the people with the topic itself on it so for example sql injection is one of the pins and then they have something which they can take into the team's room and put it on the head when you create such pins uh here is an example for the that is the logo itself the positive thing so it's a reminder because it's showing up in the room and everyone can see it every day you might don't take a close look but at least you get an overview of what you have achieved so far you get this achievement very fast because you just need to attend the training as a team um it's a gamification uh one team or multiple teams multiple teams said uh we want to collect all teams so they just showed up to get the pin so you can think is that the right motivation but i would say uh as more people are there um it's better it is and even if this is the only the initial trigger to come there uh when you're you good in presenting they will very fast be happy and follow your content yeah and said and as i said it's it transforms security to to be touchable that is one of the main things uh so you have a takeaway from the training uh as a downside is that you need to design these things uh but the positive neosites as is an overs project there are plenty of pins already i designed which you just need to print this is how how this head looks i just use this head here so that you have a point where you can collect the pins so that they are not randomly uh in the room um and here you see for example is overstopped 1080. for an overview or here you see a mobile storage security a very specific topic which i covered at one client so that we have had a deep dive what what can this be after a while so after a while i had a lot of these pins so i needed this toolbox here to collect them and you see all of them are full that is due to the reason that when you go to the meeting you don't know how many people are there so you always need to create need to develop uh a bit more uh than you think you attend this than the amount of 10 expected attendees and this is how it will look after a while but as i said it's not a problem because you will use the same topics after a while again so you then you can just hand out the pins here after uh coveted um actually this uh collection here it didn't happen anymore because we met here visually and in a virtual room you can't hand out these pins so what one of my client did is in backstage that is an asset catalogues you also have this team view in the asset catalog this is the team dog markets here and they call they uh we made a visual representation of this pins so that you can still see uh the adhesions you're having in this team view on the picture you don't see it but when you click on it you get more information when it happened and uh where the slides for the topics are so that was a team review for participating in in a training which happens every one and a half week when you create a training which happens maybe only once once in a year and you choose the overstew shop to be uh one of the tools in the trainings you can print such a poster here and then you see here these are again kind of pins stickers which you can put on it right now they are not colored but the sticker itself is colored so that you can slowly see your progress in the training as an alternative maybe a bit cheaper than to have such a poster printed is to just hand out such stickers uh and on the sticker here you see uh the levels the dew shop has different difficult difficulty uh levels and here you see that you can grow the stars on the sticker and when someone solves the tasks with difficulty 6 then you can hand out such a sticker as an achievement are there any questions so far not from my side anybody else maybe i can have a question yeah sure uh so basically can you please tell what type of way did you get the exercises or how did you build the exercises to train the team how to build the exercise bjorn has a very nice i will i will show it give me give me a second [Music] i think it's called itt security lecture yeah so bjorn has published his slides which which for the training he is giving to students and you can use this slides here he has a slide deck and the first ones are more basic basic security knowledge and when you go here on the bottom these are actually web application security related topics so you can for example go into the cross-site scripting slide so you you see how he conducts his training and obviously he will at some point uh in introduce the juice shop provide demo demonstrations and other things so that would be a starting point i would say thanks and as an alternative uh uh as i said a very nice way are the over stop ten uh so you i would say when you start uh with such a training um you should cover the over's top 10 that should be i think a target can i ask further questions obviously we had we tried uh we we implemented uh security champions in our company too and what we currently try to do is regular questionnaires into projects so pick one security champion and ask them what are the problems in their current project what could be some things to solve and um do you have any experience on this kind of process to establish what you called maintain interest i i have to think about that question you started with uh you want to perform an assessment yeah the thing is that what you what you put on this one slide maintain interest um sometimes the interest into security decreases in favor of other things other project interests and yeah then it is often not so easy to establish or to maintain the the security in one project if you have a security champion there and what we currently try to do is to establish a regular meeting with a with a or a meeting with a one person of a project and ask him [Music] questions about the project so that at the end the the wisdom what you call a knowledge base here can be spread around other projects or to other security champions to gain more information about what could be performed or to could be done better in one project yeah i see where your question is heading to and [Music] let me let me uh show you another slide which i'm which i'm having somewhere here uh that will visualize the problem we are facing maybe maybe i that is a problem which is there [Music] [Music] let me see if i quickly find it otherwise i will answer it directly where is it but i will answer it without that slight it's not so important uh so what what i have and i have discovered is that i can't tell the people what they are interested in um so that is more strategic view which i'm having now you have to tell me if that fits your your question um so i don't want to push security so that's what you're saying by i want to ask what are your pain points um i would say so that i provide a kind of a dashboard and that is the initial phase i would say i provide a dashboard uh which i present to the whole company where the teams are listed you can see it like like this so a dashboard very easy easy to create um theme one team one two three four and then you have different categories here and i highlight what is good and bad and then i automatically come into discussion with them because before i show this uh this aggregated view i give the team each team is a view for the team only so they have one week time to discuss it with me and then i i already come into this where they say this is going very bad and that's why it is like bad like this or i measure it in a wrong way and then we talk about it um or they discover that that they are doing something which which they didn't expect which they want to change and this is for me the the point where i i talk with them and then i present it to the management so the management will make sure that they work on it it's not me who tells it to them it's it's the management which pushes it down does that answer your question or was it nice nice thanks okay good because when i go to i i for example enforced once to perform a sweat modeling i i did it only once and that was the worst threat morning session i ever had the whole time the team wasn't nice to me and in the end i also wasn't nice to the team um all on a professional level obviously but it was very hard to follow and i thought the whole time should i break up or not i didn't break up uh but but i could also have stopped the shred mauling after 10 minutes [Music] and that is because i invited the team and i wanted them to make threat modeling and so so there was no outcome so they need to come to the security professionals or they need to come to the conclusion that they want to do it alone it's also okay in case they don't invite me and the team thinks okay we we want to do straight mauling and we will do it alone without others but there need to be a starting point and that is what i reach with this okay so um we we stopped here at the virtual corporate way on how to collect pins uh in the time of a pandemic in a virtual way uh we talked about training rewards and now we come to another technique which i'm using um nudging so first i need to explain what notching is nudging is for example that you see a road sign it reminds you why you're driving how fast you're allowed to drive on that specific street and after some time it reminds you again so that is kind of steering people in a in a particular direction uh which you as the one who creates the signs they want to achieve and one way are these security pins on the head but as i said you collect a lot of pins and you might you mind don't look at it very often so what i did is for very important topics so one topic which i covered at one client this is the office of the sda ase open industry solutions but it doesn't matter which company it is you see here that uh i printed the pin and placed it on on a figure here so whenever you enter the the the office you as a developer or operator pass through this uh this toy um so as open policy agent is about authorization it's very important i also added for example docker uh or no container security as one other topic which i also placed um on on such a figure here and in the end i had around three figures and it uh um i discovered that the teams play around with them and place them at different locations sometimes this place here sometimes here and here so they actually recognize uh these important topics and the figure attached to it um i i wanted to create a a measurement uh if they ask me if one figure is missing and how long it takes until they inform me uh but then coveted and i couldn't perform this measurement next to the security champion and training program it's very important to do threat mornings that are the the most important pillars in our program so threat modeling is about what are we building what can go wrong what are we going to do about it and did we do a good enough job that is taken from the argillo from the from the threat modeling money manifesto and when you want to introduce red molding in your company you need to think about how do i actually introduce this so that is a point where you can take a look at the threat modeling playbook as i said you don't need to follow it 100 you just need to get ideas how can i implement it and then you need to modify it for your own way so for example you need to get stakeholder spy and without the buy-in of the management uh the teams invest one hour two hours eight hours three days in a week whatever you feel is right um you need to get this buy-in so that they that that that the investment is supported then you need to embed it in your organization you need to train people on thread modeling then you slowly want to enhance the maturity of the thread moulding process and use nice technology base rate modeling for the step what can go wrong i personally like for example uber's cornucopia especially in the starting phase it might get a bit boring after a while but in the starting phase it's perfect so it's a card game people like the game the only thing which you need to bring is some some time to to play with these cards in the remote way you might use these cards online you can import them in some of the the um there are card games online where you can import your own decks where you can also import us cornucopia or you use a hybrid way in which you send out the cards beforehand and this has a benefit that but this participants might take a look at it before so you can play with the physical cards while you're meeting online in case you would like to have free cards uh i i could make a deal with robert ledov and here in case you sent him an email after this talk and you are an overs was german member then he will send you such such cards for free so let us come to the next devsecops dimension test and verification very important dimension two uh we can't focus on all the possible tests you can perform uh so we report so we will talk in uh now about the dynamic desk for applications um i introduced the dsm already i can't show this a slide on on everything i show you where it is located in december but uh here it's very nice to highlight this the how the devsec opportunity model can be used so first you start with simple scan so a muted model is built here from level one to four that means it gets more difficult to achieve it or it's not so important for security and you have here around at different uh the different dimensions or in this case the sub dimensions and we are now in the dynamic depth for applications so on dynamic therefore applications on level one here uh you start with a simple scan you just start over step for example and let it run against your application and take a look at the findings in the first one manually maybe at a later maturity you automate it on level two for example afterwards you need to think okay i am i might have dynamic uh parts javascript so i need to think about how do i treat uh dynamic paths you use that means you have to adjust um it just overstep a bit that you also spider in other dynamic way for example then you might have different roles which you need to test with over them it's overstep and you need to cover uh maybe uh sql operations when we think about an online shop you first put things in a specific order in the basket then you log in then you take a look at the baskets and you check out the basket you get a pdf in the end so there are steps which need to be performed in a specific order uh so that needs to be automated and maybe you need to cover a hidden path so you might have an administration interface which is not mentioned somewhere application within the application which can't be figured out in a dynamic way so you have to think how do we uh how do we make sure that zapf also takes into account the hidden web pages and when you uh in in the next maturity you don't want to use only oversap you might want to use other tools to perform the test as well this is i would say a starting point on a low maturity level which i also perform very often in the start when i come to company so i have the web uh the the the the the domain page dot pro here uh and i put it into the application over amaz amaz is a project uh which will then take a look for example i don't know how the database is called but let's encrypt you you might know let's and script and they may publish which domains they created certifications for so that might be one of the sources i must take a look at it might also take a look at well-known subdomains like mail um and it generates all the the subdomains you're having and then you can perform nmap to scan these subdomains which ports are open and then you can push this into overstep for example to figure out which ports are which which which headers are there on on the port 80 for example um i i like to perform this yeah in kind of an enterprise world in a world where you have a lot of sub-domains and no one knows what is actually there so as bigger the organization and more you have the problem i uh uh that that you don't know what is there and then this is one approach obviously as you need initially here are the the domains there might be other domains as well so that is the task which which can be hardly automated but then you need to figure out and then you can put it into armas and follow this line here then when you come would like to come to a higher maturity level uh as i said uh in the end you might want to even use multiple scanners uh then uh the project secure code box uh which is created by uh by by people mainly from hamburg uh maybe also from people around germany that are the main contributors as far as i know and the secure code box has this task to orchestrate the scanner so here you see a deployment pipeline and maybe uh you us developer commit codes in a version control system or push it in the version control system then the build starts and it create an artifact basis in a repository and rolls out to the production near system then the secure code box orchestrates its tests so that they fire against the production new system but that is kind of a kind of an old view so that is a state which i had three years back nowadays you might want to do it in a more modern way so this is the new way um you see here a kubernetes cluster so maybe you're running your application inside a kubernetes cluster then the main thing here is that you have the auto discovery which automatically detects that uh you are having a new kubernetes service and then um [Music] zap scan is started in case you have this uh annotation here enabled that auto discovery is enabled and then it pushes the finding into defect dojo and afterwards the not handled findings into slick that is a more modern way i would say so when there is a change it gets fired again defect dojo itself is a very nice system uh i first used it four years ago at that time it was very hard to deploy i have to say nowadays it's very easy to deploy it so that that there is not so much cover you can easily deploy it with a ham chart into your kubernetes cluster or use it on a simple docker machine with docker compose so the for me the main feature of the vulnerability management system like defect dojo is the so-called deduplication feature deduplication means that when you push a finding we see here uh that there is a defect dojo and the findings are getting pushed here when you you you you don't do this once right you do this whenever there is a change so maybe multiple times a day and when there is a vulnerability and you checked it and you say okay this is a false positive or i do accept this specific vulnerability for two weeks then you don't want to get informed for the next two weeks about the specific vulnerability so that's why you have this deduplication so defect dojo detects that it's already uploaded um that this finding is already present it uh it creates a reference to that finding and then it checks is it handled already so is it accepted is it uh marked as transferred um is it marked as mitigated so that is what it checks and then you can inform the team or the developer or the developers or operators about that finding so another tool which i created this is not an over project right now um and it's not open sourced in this moment but it will be open source in the next couple of weeks is a so-called cluster scanning it's a collection of multiple tools also of overs projects um and what you get with this is you test for marvel you test virtualized environments for example that the container is not running as root or that it is distress it checks for uh server-side components with known vulnerabilities so what i mean here is known components for example in java so the jars are in a container so i can check it what is running in the runtime environment and what you get indirectly from it um is what you can see here uh for you because there is also a lifetime check for example how old is the image you indirectly get that people want to enhance their patch patch life cycle so they want to push new containers more often with new images under it so how is it working uh you have an image collector in the different clusters you're running then you have an orchestrator that's how i call it that orchestrator collects the images and then it performs scans for example the august dependency check here which is performing checks based on jars and collects the um the vulnerabilities for it from the national vulnerability database and these findings are getting pushed into defect dojo and then you can inform via email for example or via messenger likes like the developers about that finding and only once because the developer can perform a risk acceptance for example in the in the tool risk acceptance as we have seen now in this slide beforehand a risk acceptance can be performed and then the the developer will not get notified again so let us come to the next project i would like to highlight here that is a project which i actually have used um only as a as a user um so the over up sensor um there is a is a tool around it i from my point of view the tool around this is not so important what is important here uh is a paper for it which highlights here what you should actually lock when there is a security event happening so from my point of view it might be even more powerful than the web application firewall because you are defined water lock and then you have detection points in your application for example when there is an input exception happening and then you define when to inform the developer about this special event um and uh what information uh the developer will get so i mainly like here uh the the idea about it and and the the intellectual property um so that that i can use it to get ideas when to inform developers and which which thresholds uh need needs to be reached so my my conclusion for today um is that open source projects and knowledge is very good um and it's not good for startup and for enterprises so it's it can be used in both words from my point of view as i have shown all these projects i use uh in clients which are for example startups or enterprise clients um and all all of that in the area of security and always has a lot of useful projects uh so that you can uh you can get the benefits that other people already thought about these problems and you can just use it questions actually i have a question uh to you timo i found a first of all very interesting the the different obas projects that you've been using so we've seen quite a lot like the devsecops maturity model the secure codebox security pins and so on um was wondering for people who might be interested in participating with oas projects to get involved what is the best way to get started with active contribution contribution yeah there there are different different maturities of contributions let's say so uh the start is to create an issue [Music] issue no i can't write here but all i can is you um the next step is to be involved in slack so always has a slack account uh for example you can join dsim in case you want to talk about the devsec opportunity model there is also a slack for defect due to shop and so on and then the next level uh would be to not express your ideas or the next level would be to create a pull request which actually suggests an improvement for that project implement in an implemented way great thank you i think it's um i'll also post the the slack channel in a second in the channel if you're interested in getting involved because i think there's a lot of interesting projects and um especially the ones that you mentioned i think was one of the the top ones just to learn more about i found it also quite easy to get involved with the community as you said just opening an issue seeing if there's any more thoughts on that and then basically just open your own pull request and make active contribution cool anybody any other questions perhaps another question um what is your experience uh you you showed a lot of automatic tools um wasp zap scanning to maintain this stuff yes that is let us let us take a look i can give you some numbers um so this here is let's say four hours to create it and then you run it when you feel like right so then the maintenance is when you want to run it let's say once in a month uh it it takes your depending on the size here but i will just make one up let's say it takes you eight hours to talk with the people to solve it and so on so just just to have a have a have a number in mind so that is not so much i would say when you come to this one here or or this one this just to set it up might be a hundred days and then you have to maintain it so after this hundred days uh then it depends on what you see as maintaining costs do you see maintenance cost is operating this that it works or do you see maintenance costs in case in terms of you need to talk with the developers to solve their problems so because my experience is if you implement a new feature and you have a black box or a web application proxy in between you a lot of times have to add this new feature that the automatic tools understand what to do a little bit like selenium tests or something like that yeah here uh here i i don't see so much maintenance in in that terms obviously the secure codebox releases new features that you have to implement but on the server side uh i'm using open api so that gives me already most of the things so in the live so when you create when you use an application with user different authentication mechanism then you need to have or a bigger adjustment i would say so as soon as you're not following the stack in your application which is there and what you build this for then you have again more workload but as soon as long as you follow it and you say okay all applications have open api and i use uh all out tokens with with key clock for example and you created that it works with key clock and that is the case for the next two years then the maintenance overhead is not it's only taught to implement new secure good books but when you change your application development then you have to expect more overhead here yes thanks any more questions let me just ask also another question i'm quite interested in um timo so as you said you you represent quite a few projects uh some of them that you develop yourself uh which one like which are your top three os projects that you think are re-helping your day-to-day work as a devsecops consultant apart from of course from the ones that you created yourself um [Music] yeah so i'm i'm a lot into these uh automation so now let me start in a different way so the first one is i would say the community that i can ask people so that is what helps me the most i would say so that is not a project that is just that you can ask in slack and you get an answer very fast so what i often hear is that when you have a have a a company behind it you can ask and create tickets and that is faster than open source but that is not the case from my point of view i get answers very fast so that is what helps me a lot i would say then afterwards um it's it's hard to say so i would say the juice shop is very good for for trainings so that there is a high benefit with this very low uh budget then i would say the next one is defect dojo because it's independent from from the scanners you're using you need to put it somewhere at a centralized place and i'm not allowed to use my my own projects right so let me think um [Music] yeah right now i'm actually implementing this here uh the secure good box at the client's place uh and i have the uh expectation that it helps a lot thank you thank you i think what you point out is really true um also if you have any questions and like if you want to know more about an obas project or a certain issue or on application security you can just go to ask the community reach out ask questions go into slack or just actively contribute and um yeah i think it's definitely helpful and as you said for myself i also use the factor quite a lot i found it very helpful just to visualize the the vulnerabilities let's integrate this also with other security tooling so i find quite a few os projects that i use a lot in in our customers devsecops pipelines so thank you any more questions i guess we can move on thank you very much thank you great thank you very much timo that was really interesting just to learn more about the different obas projects that you've been using and as we've seen there was quite a few one like the devsecops maturity model security pins defect dojo the asam if you're interested on learning more about the projects just and that's something i'll show in in a short while just go on os.org and go on projects you probably noticed they have restructured the website so um they i think find it quite quite useful useful just to get an overview and understanding of the of the different projects and just try it out yourself you know just install um like the juice shop just install it locally run it locally test it out or same with the the zap proxy or just with the security pin um timo maybe you can offer this to to to get some security pins um just for for participants or at least you can probably i think they're available on on um on your github page right to print out absolutely you have to print you need to have your own printer right but you can print them out by yourself yeah that is the target awesome great thank you okay so [Music] let's have a quick break of five minutes and then we continue our talk with uh with my overview of the os shop and how to get started in a couple of challenges so i'm just gonna share my screen i just have a five minute break okay so we'll be back around 19 like seven ten in 5 minutes okay okay let's just wait one or two minutes more okay hope everybody or most of you are already back from your break and ready to continue can everybody see my screen yep perfect okay great so we continue this uh evening with now a hands-on seminar on the obas do shop so team empargo mentioned a team of pirates just mentioned shortly uh the way of how to use the jew shop and this is being a good way an opportunity for a training platform around application security what we're showing you is how to get started with that and solve some really interesting challenges in in the do shop and also show a couple of bonus challenges so let's get started just so first of all in order to get some of the os dew shop just go on the os.org page and you will see on the top is the projects the chapters and the events section and if you go on the projects overall with your mouse you will see that it's always already the os top 10 dependency track and then the due shop as the flagship os projects so just click on that and this will forward you to the overview page that i think timo also already briefly showed before so as mentioned the os shop claims to be the most modern and sophisticated ncq web application and is used by various security professionals as well as by developers as a guinea pig for security tooling and also as a security awareness platform and it's also in compliant with the entire os top 10 along with other security flaws also note that on the web page it says the application contains i think over 100 different challenges so a lot of time just to spend on different challenges for different vulnerabilities and all the hacking progress is tracked on a scoreboard however the scoreboard is actually one of the easier challenges to solve so this is hidden and we as the attacker want to find out how to get there and that's something we going to focus on first and as part of the first challenge before that i let's have an overview of how to get started with installing the the juice shop first of all you just need to click on the github page this will forward you to bjorn kimenes who is the creator of the do shop juice shop overview page essentially all the the code is publicly available on github and if you're interested in just understanding how the application is built you can all go in here and check out the code yourself what i will be doing is just focus on the setup sections briefly here the juice shop itself can be installed in different ways it can be installed on the cloud provider of your choice azure container amazon ec2 or you can just install it locally from source however what i'm going to focus on is on running on the docker container that's pretty simple if you just install a docker container client on your machine or in the server and let's run docker pull of the became an h2 shop container and just it will run it locally on port 3000 also be aware there's actually 15 million pulls of the container docker container of the juicer which i find quite an interesting number so somebody in the background keeps pulling those docker uh images off the juicer but somebody really likes that so um yeah just just an interesting fun fact okay let's get started with the first challenge as soon as we go and start our docker container locally which i've already done in this case we can just first of all look around the juice shop just get familiar with the application itself it looks and feels like a regular web shop if you just click on on the products you can see there's apple juice somebody left a review which is claimed to be the admin juice shop so looks like the app an account and also you can log in as a user with your regular email passwords and you can also register as a customer that's just something feeds and looks like a real webshop also there's various languages available so i think the juice shop is over 73 languages so quite a few so that's also something you get involved if you feel like the user is not available in your language just open a pull request all right however we know that the hidden scoreboard page is somewhere in the application that's not referenced anywhere so what we're going to do well just know that for just to get started with the juice shop we don't really need a lot of fancy security tooling like a proxy like burp or zap i mean for advanced challenges you definitely need it but for the easier ones all you need is just the inspect tool set of your local browser so just right click on that click on inspect and this will now show you open the the inspector toolset and it will um i found it quite useful also on firefox that you can even edit and resend network requests in in the in the application however we are going to focus on the debugger section now looking on the debugger section we'll see the javascript files that the application is using and if we now look at the main es2018.gs this looks like it's the main javascript source file that the application is using if we just scroll down you see there's a lot of lines of code like over 20 000 lines of code and to be honest nowhere in the world i'm going to read through all of the code myself it's just too much to to understand too much just to worry about the first step just to find indications of hidden pages let's just look for something that by just opening ctrl f and look for certain keywords like in our case score or scoreboard so dory it shows up something interesting like this some exceptions being raised for scoreboard let me just try to score dashboard and looks like there's also a selector that indicates there is an app scoreboard inside the the code reference let's just look a bit further and see what happens and what we can see here now is that the path which is up here the search path is also indicated in in the source code so we can find a path that has recycle one for the register one for hacking instructor and also one for score dashboard so with this knowledge in mind we can just guess now or have an educated guess of where the scoreboard might lie so if we just now copy this and type in the score board let's see what's going to happen wow looks like we've just solved our first challenge in the os shop so what we've seen now is that by just looking through the front and source code of the web application we were able to identify a hidden page left by developer or left just by um by somebody in the page and from this we can just access that so this itself is quite common what i what we've seen or right i've seen as part of uh pen testing engagements or security assessments that sometimes code snippets are just being forgotten or lost and they're still left on the web server now looking at the scoreboard itself it has over 100 challenges available and the interesting thing is that all the challenges can be selected by the overwatch top 10 vulnerabilities so from broken access control over to code injection cross-site scripting it's all in there all for you to try out and challenge yourself now in the next step let's just focus on a cross-site scripting challenge i'm just going to select this one here and this will have a couple of challenges including one that is the dom based cross site scripting challenge from the description it says to perform a dom based cross-site scripting attack by using this payload so i'm going to just copy this to my clipboard and see whether i can find a way somewhere to inject this into the application so before we start with this what is dom-based cross-site scripting dom-based cross-site script is essentially a attack a crosshair scripting attack that allows you to inject client side javascript code into the victim machine or into into the browser and it's not reflected in the response of the server which makes it really difficult to detect and those kind of vulnerabilities can allow an attack to steal session tokens install a key logger or get to the user to perform an arbitrary action that is unwanted so let's just copy this to a clipboard and go back to the ushop and look around where we could inject potentially some code in here but the first that comes into the mind is the search bar so if you just type in apple we can see that this results are shown here so apple juice and yeah it's just looking like a regular search bar however let's just try this just to inject a header attack into the application this basic html code and see what's coming back well no results are found but looking at that we see that actually the header tags are already reflected inside what it looks like being processed by the dom and looking at that we can actually see here that the headers are actually being properly processed so with this easy test we can already know that this might be a potential sync for our cross-site scripting so now let's just take our payload which is an iframe that just injects a javascript executes a javascript alert with cross-site scripting so for your pen testers that's probably the most easiest way just to test for any sort of cross-site scripting and see what happens well looks like we've just solved our second challenge now with our payload we were able to successfully inject the iframe with a alert box that shows cross-site scripting into the application as you see there is very poor input sanitization done on on the client side that leads to that as well as also showing some hidden information like some error message however i'm aware that i was made aware by timo pagle that there's actually an additional challenge for that um dom based crosshatch scripting attack that i want to highlight which shows really like how far you can go with a dom based cross-site scripting attack and for this one can i just kind of show you the shake logger piece uh which is an extra challenge of the juice shop so team of power created this just to inject additionally instead of injecting an iframe we are now injecting a shake.gs javascript file with a malicious code and on the client server we will have a logger.php running that is going to trying to perform or record the keystrokes of the user and there's this phishing link provided that we as a user would click and that's what i'm going to show right now is we are now logged in we don't need to be logged in we are just uh getting this phishing email from the valued as a valid customer and beyond kim niche as a ceo tells us wow it's something free there's a big lottery to win and we just want to claim our price right now and just going over the link you see that this already encoded javascript code inside or running on or just included on the target application so let's just click on that and see what happens well looks like we are just now logged into the application or we'll just access the application without being logged in now this part of the challenge there is going to be some interesting music running in the background uh that is just part of the challenge uh i just disabled that because you can't really hear that there's also some funny um shaking of of the the application so basically we now look into the inspect piece and look in the debugger section we can see that apart from the sources that we've just seen we also have a shake js running included on another port or another local application that is actually being used and this makes it looking an interesting way well the interest the thing is like okay this looks a bit funny but let's just assume we as a user now just want to try to log in with our credentials and just make a regular purchase well as again it just feels an x normally however as the attacker we are now running and this could be potentially on a remote hose very easily we are running a logger.php application now whatever whatever just is inserted my username then go to west.org my password which is this one here it's just a bit cut off but essentially we were now as attacker was able to key stroke the login of the application by just using that local logger dot shake.js file and we also able to gain access to the to the cookie of the user including the access token and i found this quite interesting to see how far we can get and as i said we've seen this i've seen this quite a lot with uh with customers in pentest that it's not just about popping up an alert box but you can actually go quite far and perform advanced attacks like this now let's now look back on another challenge so let's go back let's reload the page in order to avoid this bit annoying shaking and go back to the scoreboard and focus this time on another attack which is the code injection attack so clicking here on the scoreboard on the injection site we find various challenges as you're aware is that code injection is the top num number one of the overasp vulnerabilities hence there's a lot of interesting challenges for you to solve and one is uh to log in as the administrator's user account so it's a login admin and let's just try to do this and step up the challenge first of all all we know is we just need to log in with the admins user account so let's just go back on the side look around on the page and we can see there's this apple juice preview here and there's a user called admin at juice sh.op that said it's one of his favorite products well let's just now take an educated guess take this user and try to log in so let's need to log out from my current account because i'm just a regular user login and now what we could do is just start guessing a password as you start guessing doing a brute force of of passwords this might be successfully like it might be successful if you keep doing this for a while you might get locked out the user might get logged off for some reason which takes a lot of time and that's not part of the challenge so let's just try something else usually with code injection attacks we would want just to insert first of all backtick so i'm just going to open the console right now let's do on the side and insert a backtick which is just the easiest way just to test for sql injection and see what's going to happen so before i do that just to see what what says the login says invalid email or password now let's just insert a backtick and see what happens looks like we actually solved another challenge by provoking an error that was not successfully or consistently handled so we can see here it says now object object that doesn't look like something would expect coming from the application right going back to the console and clicking on the error message was shown going to the response we can see here that we have an error message being thrown from a sqlite error which already gives us really juicy information about what has been happening and for our luck we can even read the whole sql statement inside the error message and see how the application is performing its logic so what we can see here is that there's a query where it selects all the users from the database where the email is the even of the user which is inserted and a md5 password hash and that's actually something we can already use for our attack purpose just to take the hash and start cracking it and guessing whether we're able to find out the correct password however when we look very closely we can see that the backtick that we've just inserted here is right down after the email and that's something from the attacker's perspective that we can now use just to step up the challenge and perform a sql injection attack so let's just do this further and now say or one equals one which essentially equals all the this query until here till true and then insert a comment for the sql statement which basically comments out the rest of our sql statement and ignores all the password so with this in mind just take a minute or just take a quick guess what is going to happen now now with this one we are now inserting a backtake it's equalling it to true and commenting on the rest of the of of the code and now trying to log in you don't even need to worry about password we have given something one we are now successfully logged in as the user of the of the admin user of the due shop and this was because of the injection attack we've just done just manipulating the sql statement on the on the client side in order for our favorite not to provide any sort of password or any sort of authentication and again that's also another challenge we just solved login admin challenge and in fact you don't even need to in that case you don't even need to select the the app and login because if you just insert that sql statement without providing any email you would get also logged in because the the admin is the first user of the database so when you log in with that statement you are already logged in as the as the app and user so no need to actually find out the admin user email great so again that's i think a very visible and interesting attack of sql injection what i kindly asked you now to do is just to step up the challenge and go to the jew shop of the jew shop heroku app that's something i'm just oh actually it's just down i'll just still post it in the chat or go locally just go on the due shop page of beyond kim niche and install the application yourself try out a couple of challenges try to log into the scoreboard try to perform cross-site scripting using a dom-based cross-site scripting attack and log in as the app and user and see how whether you're able to to solve those challenges yourself as i said there's over 100 challenges inside the application all for you to try out and learn more about application security and even some advanced ones where you can just install malware from a target system and run this in the context of the application yeah if you have any questions about the juicer want to get involved feel free to join our slack channel or just open and issue a pull request on github and that's it hope you enjoyed it are there any questions i have a question how long would it take approximately to solve all the challenges they're like 100 challenges right yes to be honest i haven't tried solving all of the challenges but just considering is that yeah there's 100 challenges and different um we just show this different type of levels it will probably take you a while to solve them i would just guess probably a couple of weeks or days of depending of course on the experience maybe timo you can even give some some thoughts on this from your side have you solved a couple of challenges yeah i have i have solved a couple of challenges but i i never solved all of them i would say it takes months there is there is a guy i don't know his name he wanted to to provide a few years back uh all the solutions for all challenges on his video and after a while he recognized that it's a lot of stuff i agree yeah so yeah just take some time off then if you want to learn more the good thing is that um some of the or some of the challenges are available on a github book by bjorn kemeny so if you're getting stuck and you want to learn more it's also from the hacking instructor perspective if you want to train your developers or other system administration on how how to do hands-on hacking you can use this as a platform for capture the flag hacking and enable also run it in this in a different mode just to have this hacking instructor mode and you can also have a walk through through different challenges yourself and then let the the developers do more the the advanced work any more questions yes one question if you want to install it or if you want to perform it in the company teemo showed the pins and incentives you can do um what is a possibility to do it i just i just wonder okay you set up a server and everybody can connect or you say everybody has to do it at localhost but on the other side it would be nice if you can compare the scores of the participants to each other yeah what uh what would be a good solution yeah and that's actually a very good question because in fact the jew shop itself offers that hacking instructor mode so you would as a as the hacking instructor you would have your own interface and seeing different uh users or different members of of the of the ctf team solving those challenges and they can even compete with each other on a global scoreboard saying this uh those are the challenges have been solved and this person has solved that challenge so cool yep definitely possible any more questions and we're just extending quickly on the other one there's a companion guide so that's the toning juice shop that you can use just to run this as i said as a workshop yourself okay there's another question chet okay from from timor that that is a private question okay sorry [Laughter] that's good uh any other questions so i'm gonna show how to host a capture the flag event so this should give you some more information on how to host this as a ctf event including a different mode so if there's no more questions from the audience i think we can go on uh also be aware that uh johannes schwimbon will host an um more deep dive session of the overwatch shop in the upcoming weeks that there's going to be dive more into specific details and specific channels of the jew shop so just stay tuned and it's going to be made available on eventbrite and if you're interested just just ping us or yeah just stay tuned on on the meetup page and have a check on our local community stamptis event page on github 100 challenges in 20 minutes how hard can it be record it and then just play a 10 time speed [Laughter] cool then let's just go on with our next speaker just okay all right can you see my screen perfect so we're looking forward now for our next lightning talk on physical red teaming which is going to be provided by miyage stanievic mihail is a this is a ceo and founder of six dimension dot io and he's currently specializing in security audits and security assessments with a focus on physical security and he's also had his fair share of experience with physical returning assessments that he's going to share with us in in his lightning talk all right we have mia are you ready to present yes i am do you hear me properly yes we can hear you then i'll just share my screen can you see it yes we can see your screen okay perfect so um yeah as um dan already uh introduced me i'm working as a consultant in various regulated industries i have around about like 15 years of experience and a very interesting topic for us in the in the current market will be the topic of physical security and the pen testing of physical security so that's a topic that's in germany not very developed yet it's something that we more know from the u.s sector as you can see in several videos on several conferences but the topic is more and more coming and it is also really important and it's absolutely exciting so what i want to give you today is like a quick insight about the physical pen testing in the aspect of the red teaming uh for us one of the most important references in this area is the iso 27001 i will explain quickly how this is connected and show you two quick samples of how things can go very bad very quickly and yeah also talk about the aspect of our now everywhere present topic of um home office in the end i will give you just four quick hints what you can do to make your area safer so physical security is can be divided basically into two topics um like secure areas and secure equipment the iso27001 has therefore two parts or two sections in the annex which is the a11 that focuses mainly on the physical perimeter and how to protect this and how to access it or how to set the controls to access it properly and the nx 11 2 or a112 is more focused on the devices on the on all your utilities that you have for example like also cabling and how to maintain your stuff properly so um one of the real life stories i was auditing a client in the financial sector and you always go there where you can cause the most chaos where you can destroy the most where you can kill most people and that's usually stuff like infrastructure like a silver room okay so we went there we just walked along and um the my guide on the on the tour showed me the server room and when i do this i mentally always prepare for okay how can i attack you go through all your experience through all your steps and when you have time and when you can do it you always like to try to pick a lock this situation was when i faced uh in terms of lock picking one of my hardest challenges and i think i found the the first really unpickable lock on the market and it looked like this so what's the issue here we have no lock that we can pick because we basically have no lock at all on the door and um so okay this was this was already one of uh of the of the frightening moments in this audit until you see this now the next step would be depending on your um assignment what to do to for example attack the hardware that's in there but why to bother to attack any hardware when you can just take out the whole server so you just basically unscrew it if it's screwed in and if not then you just take it on your arm you unplug it and you go away and next uh the next or the second example of how things can go very wrong where very quickly is this one here we again audited a client and um everybody of us knows the new trend now with several companies that are delivering the drinks directly to the office when you need it and these people are not really trained to focus on security i took this picture here and it was the third or fourth time that this happened and even worse on the next floor up where it went into the building into the office spaces there were of course also boxes of drinks that were keeping the next door open so basically here the physical perimeter is completely broken and you even really don't need to contest anything there because you can just walk through what challenges do we face in the home office area um in the home office area we have unmanaged infrastructure or insecure infrastructure we have unknown devices where we don't know how safe they are and uh one of the most interesting attacks there which is like i'm a little bit undecided if i would count this into physical pen testing or infant testing in general is the rogue access point and we did a proof of concept for this and this really works so especially if you have an area where your notebook is standing where you have very bad reception you can just give it a nicer signal and the notebook will switch if it's not configured properly the second part of the home office problem is you have a very unsafe environment so you have untrained people around you people who maybe don't know how to handle your hardware properly when standing around you have kids maybe you have maybe pets that will um i mean i know that um dogs like notebooks and as it was in school that you said i couldn't do my homework because my dog ate it i think the next big thing should be there i couldn't work because my dog ate my notebook and of course you also have the risk of um theft in your own apartment or in your house or burglary or whatever so that your hard work gets stolen because normally your building is not as secured as a proper office building or like a commercial building you have no security service there you have nothing what's to take away from this quick talk when you are somewhere in a secured area where most likely somebody made his mind why something is there why this door has to be locked why it is secured keep in mind that every measure counts as you saw in the photograph with this uh with a with the drinks in the door if this door is open that's bad but if the next door upstairs is open it's even worse and the result is that people are thinking oh yeah i will just keep this one door open and you know somewhere else there is a person who thinks exactly the same thing especially in summer when it's warm and you can just walk through buildings don't be gullible one thing that annoys me the most when i'm at my clients is that i don't know if this is a special german thing but we have this culture of you should be nice to people you should open the door because it could be potentially a client of your company and this is just wrong if you don't know somebody don't open the door just ask them nicely to batch in like everybody else and if they cannot batch in send them to the to the security counter protect your assets when you leave your office um be sure that your screen is locked be sure that your container or your shelf or whatever you have is locked um if i'm allowed to i make a very nice i have a very nice habit of just walking around during the day through offices and collecting notebooks this is um very i was educated in this way by one big consulting company where when you left your notebook somewhere unattended you could just find a card on your on your desk later that says yeah feel free to go to the i.t service and pick up your notebook and always it is important to keep your eyes open if you see something say something to the person who's in charge for the security in this building either broken doors broken windows people that are not there usually things that change that look weird always report them because if the facility management doesn't know about it they cannot fix it and if the if nobody in the company is aware about the security topic or about a security issue it won't get fixed thank you any questions um i have a question um you talked about home office and about um the comparison between the parameter of a and home office what could be high probable killing chains in home office so if i if i think okay i'm now like you said you have not so high defense mechanisms um what could be your killing chain you could potentially just break in somewhere steal the hardware then you are again back to the point that every security measure counts so if you have hardware that's not encrypted or something you have access to the data um i really liked our proof of concept with the with the rogue access point where you could just um access the the the hardware or the the the data traffic and uh another really easy one if you are living like in this new uh fancy structures you know where um like here in frankfurt like or who by foot lord so you can basically just take it by binoculars and you can look at what people do i live in opposite of a bank uh and i can literally with enough zoom i can read what the people do on their notebooks on their computers in the building and this is the same thing that you can do also with um with people somewhere and it always of course that the question is the probability of it so um how valuable am i as a target but if you know that a ceo or whatever is uh somewhere living around you and you have the the view line so to say into the um into this private area then this could be one attack what was in my mind was um there is a darkness diaries podcast about the linkedin preach um and there was i don't know uh millions of credentials which were exfiltrated and the the he told it talks about it and it was because uh when it comes to current it was uh public the the documents were made public available and um this was uh the hacker first looked who has who's a possible target so one who is uh vpn uh with uh cisco as its uh description in the social media and then he went uh and looks around okay he has a blog page um and the blog page was hosted at home uh and then he found i think it was he could make a reverse uh shell using a web vulnerability i don't know i think it was uh yeah it could be could make a web a reverse shell and um then he uh detects that he detected that he was inside a vm and made a brute force attack against ssh login he broke he found the credentials of the days and uh then he was at the imac and at the imac there was a private key and all the software uh for the vpn log into linkedin and then he exfiltrated all the data yeah i mean one one thing that that i um that i do so to say as a nighttime and weekend hobby sometimes is i like to to break into smart home devices uh preferably um the the best thing to buy there is like you just go on amazon and you shop for on black friday for the cheapest smart home because this is something that you will find a lot and these things for example introduce you huge security issues in your home network and from there on you can also go on to the rest of your network actually i have also something just to add on on what i've seen in terms of physics physical security especially in in cities like in berlin um it's been quite common that there's some organized crime at the moment going on where there are gangs that are using drones just very small drones with a with a camera attached just to scan um on office buildings just to see who's in there what are people typing on the keyboard keyboard and you can even do this you know if at night also just for for uh finding potential targets just to to break into somebody's home like you know where ceo might be living in a certain area just drive around the drone at night and see what's inside and of course that's illegal but um it has happened it's quite common so i think that's also something to consider especially when you work from home whether somebody is flying around drones in the neighborhood and they're not reporting that we currently we have the benefit of that basically in terms of burglary or stealing things we have the benefit that hopefully most of the peoples are staying at home um i mean there are a lot of these horror stories out there uh when where people just um like either you just know by by the the uh advertising on the car to which company the car belongs or and you break into the car and you steal the notebook now at the moment the likelihood is very low that the notebooks are in the cars but in general you have this issue that you can just take it from the car i i know like a ton of people and it's always a little bit you know like um not nice in the private area to be the person who's always like hey you shouldn't do this you shouldn't do this you have a security issue you know you don't make friends with this so um basically the point is um that that it depends a lot on uh on the on the whole package like where you store your stuff and um and yeah so how how accessible is it because um i found out on in my in my very painful way that most of the cars don't have any alarm after my cars after my car got dropped um and um it's yeah you can basically just go around break a window and take it um one other story that that's not very representative for germany because uh luckily the people don't use it but um you have it for example um i found this a lot in the middle east uh when i was traveling around or also in latin america um this whole story of um keypads on doors that you just have we just have to unscrew one screw and you can basically like shortcut it so you can open the door um that's also something that's um quite easy and common to use um yeah i mean sometimes in in like student dorms you'll have uh normal keys uh so like like the old school keys for normal room doors um i have a whole key chain of these things i never break them because i just i look in there and i know roughly okay it's number 32 or 35 and then i just open the door this is also one common way how how to get through something great thank you actually i also have a quick question around uh social engineering and physical security what do you think from your experience um how much does it help like in certain situations like doing any social engineering for example on security guards or just on the regular employee who just wants to get into the building and just to follow him have you had a lot of experience with that uh yeah so the topic of physical security or physical pen testing and social engineering are basically you cannot do one without the other be always nice to the people always just chat with the security guards they are usually sitting at very good places where you can see okay how does it work how much attention does he pay to people who walk through somewhere or just be like super friendly i i did it in one case that um that i chatted a lot with the security guard in another building of the company or of the bank where i was not even assigned with my office so i could anyway just batch in there with my card but he didn't know that i have a card he didn't know that um that that i'm that he didn't have any proof that i'm working for the bank so i just chatted with him on a regular basis and uh one day where i really had to go into this and it was it was by accident i really i didn't have my badge with me i needed to get in i was just like oh yeah sorry i forgot my badge i have to go really urgently to this meeting and um he just opened the the door uh like the bypass and i could walk through and this is something that you can just do in the same way for what i use social engineering at most is to find out about problems in the processes of the security guards of the of the team um you just chat with them you just ask them you you basically interview them in a very um friendly way and environment and you you can find out a lot about like the security breaches that they have um in terms of um yeah one of my favorite statements of the security guard was when i asked him yeah so it was a very it's it's a very long building literally it's like three buildings attached to each other so you can if you are on the highest floor you can walk through basically like like um 200 300 meters through the city and um i asked him so yeah how is it in the night when you when you do your tour and you you have an alarm in the in the most far away building um section and he was like yeah we would just go there and when we do our tour like uh um and then we check it because if i go there when it when the alarm is raised if i until i arrive there it's anyway too late and this is a nightmare statement i mean it's just like you go and uh so so i know there um and this is like this is not just like this one guy this is like a like a very very normal symptom that they have um that if you're just fun as far away as possible from the guards where they are sitting you just need to know where they are sitting and you go to the most far away place in the building and you have a very very good chance of just breaking in without getting caught tailgating is of course also part of social engineering which you can do everywhere you just follow the people you just follow the herd and you walk in great thank you mia for sharing your experience around your physical security experience and you've seen there's quite a lot of various aspects on on that like social engineering or just trying the easiest way and locked or easy doors that you can just they're just being open so thank you very much for for sharing that yeah one one more comment about this um if the people are interested we can make a longer talk about this because this is just like a quick um view into and it would be much easier to talk two hours about it than just one uh during this ten minutes um so if the people are interested they can just give feedback and then we can make a longer session about this thank you for your attention thank you mia yeah thanks okay so um think now johannes do you want to give a couple of uh afterwards uh yeah i mean should we start the the feedback session on slido exactly i think it's a great idea so [Music] i think i've just opened that right now can you maybe share your screen just to get the feedback session open ah let me see where's the slide only so if everybody if you have your slido still open on your phone you probably see that there is a feedback form for us just to provide your uh your input uh maybe to keep the number again not that i didn't note it down but if anybody else did forget note it down i am going to do that should i share my screen would you have though like that yeah i think that actually there's a couple of things over public um yeah just use the meeting code 7978 you see we already have some feedback collected and just we also need to see when to close down the recording and yeah just just give us some feedback uh if you have any other questions yep yeah otherwise keep it open yeah i just wanted to say otherwise thanks everybody for attending and then uh you are free to unmute yourself and join the after banter the only thing is i cannot see the q a things coming in so you need to have a look at that then yep i can do that just look at that also um i think we discussed also another upcoming event around the end of june so 29th of june is that correct johannes yes so the date itself would be the i think the 28th or 29th like you said and we are looking to catch up with the the full hands-on session so for today uh was having timo and me all around we did opt out to postpone that part but again also for the feedback if you liked what dan was doing and showing and you would like to do that yourself hands on then feel free to to write that on the slider page so we can also a little bit estimate more or less how high the participation would be so we already started with creating um an iso image that would have for example the juice shop and the bird proxy community edition installed we would then hand that out like a week before end of june so you could prepare and then we would simply take a lot of time slowly walk through a couple of those challenges and then see how it works out maybe we do that then every other month or so on the technical side maybe juice shop maybe something else depending of then how we see how far the participants are and what they're interested in we could also break out into other things like uh yeah very simple expert development on learning images like um protostar or nebula that's on something you can google or that we could talk about yeah so preparations are ongoing for this the only thing uh i also had a had a quick talk with pure just now um we need to need to see if we then will do that under the ova's banner or outside of overs because the original idea was that as soon as covert is over uh and we are having the meet up in person again probably in the hotel capri like yeah now two years ago almost the idea was that we would have a main stage with a talk or two and break out rooms where we would have to collect a little fee of the participant for these hands on training so we can pay for the rooms but that seems to be not possible under the overs manner so maybe those things would be differently structured unless we find a sponsor but yeah we will see about that as you can see there's a lot of things lined up so if you're interested in learning more and i'm just getting some of the feedback in that we really enjoyed uh the the different talks and also maybe another talk on physical pen testing as well as a deep dive on on do shop or different projects so that's something aptly can organize great i am or you want to say anything you want to say before i stop the recording oh no okay then let me stop the recording
