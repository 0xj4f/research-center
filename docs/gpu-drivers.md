**NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060** is the **GPU chip** (the silicon) made by **NVIDIA**.

**ASUS, Gigabyte, MSI, etc.** are **AIB (Add-In Board) partners**. They buy the chip from NVIDIA and build their own custom versions of the GPU card.

### Differences between brands (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte):
- **Cooling**: Different fans, heatsinks, vapor chambers
- **Clock Speeds**: Some overclocked (OC) editions
- **Build Quality**: Better PCB layout, more phases, stronger capacitors
- **Size**: 2-slot, 3-slot, compact or full-size
- **RGB and Aesthetics**: Looks and lights
- **Price**: Premium brands = higher price

### Same things across all:
- **Same core GPU chip (AD107 for RTX 4060)**
- **Same base CUDA cores, RT cores, VRAM size**

### Best case:
- You get better thermal performance, quieter operation, and slight boost in FPS from OC models.

### Worst case:
- Cheap variants overheat, thermal throttle, or fail over time due to poor quality components.

### Practical takeaway:
- Choose based on **budget + cooling + case size**.
- If small case → choose compact model.
- For better longevity → choose model with better cooling and reviews.
