Installing the drivers on servers and/or for computing purposes
You can either rely on automatic detection, which will install the driver that is considered the best match for your hardware:

sudo ubuntu-drivers --gpgpu install
Or you can tell the ubuntu-drivers tool which driver you would like installed. If this is the case, you will have to use the driver version (such as 535) and the -server suffix that you saw when you used the ubuntu-drivers --gpgpu list command.

Let’s assume we want to install the 535-server driver (listed as nvidia-driver-535-server):

sudo ubuntu-drivers --gpgpu install nvidia:535-server
You will also want to install the following additional components:

sudo apt install nvidia-utils-535-server

```
