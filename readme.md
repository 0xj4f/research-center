# AI Agent Research Center

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to build an agentic research system that autonomously collects, analyzes, and summarizes information from various internet sources. The system focuses on high-signal content in cybersecurity and crypto trading domains.

## Core Functions

1. Scrape and ingest information from:
   - YouTube transcripts
   - PDF documents
   - LinkedIn posts
   - Reddit posts
   - Twitter/X posts

2. Agent responsibilities:
   - Summarize and analyze collected data
   - Provide actionable insights and future implications
   - Suggest how to store and query this knowledge effectively
   - Tag all collected data for context and searchability
   - Feed into a dashboard with searchable memory and metrics

## Primary Data Focus

### Cybersecurity
- DevSecOps
- Red Team
- Blue Team

### Trading
- Cryptocurrencies
  - Bitcoin (BTC)
  - Ethereum (ETH)
  - Solana (SOL)

## Dashboard and Tagging

Collected data will be:
- Tagged with relevant metadata
- Indexed for semantic and keyword search
- Displayed in a dashboard for exploration, filtering, and querying

## Planned Tech Stack

- Python-based web scrapers and automation agents
- LLM pipelines for summarization and classification
- Vector database (e.g., Chroma, Weaviate, or FAISS)
- API and dashboard frontend (e.g., FastAPI + React or Streamlit)

## Project Status

Work in progress. Contributions and discussions are welcome.
